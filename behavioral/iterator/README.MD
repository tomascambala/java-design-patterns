## INTENT

Without exposing its underlying representation sequentaially provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object. Also known as Cursor.

## Applicability
- when you want support multiple traversals of aggregate objects
- when you want to access object's contents without exposing  its internal representation 
- support polymorphic iteration - to provide uniform interface for traversing different aggregate structures
