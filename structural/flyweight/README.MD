# INTENT

Large numbers of fine-grained objects use sharing to support effectively

## Applicapibility

- large numbers of objects
- most of object can be excentric
- expensive storage beacause of the sheer quantity of objects
- code doesn't depend on object identity. Object may be shared, identity test for conceptually distinct objects will return true
- many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared object once extrinsic state is removed
