# INTENT

Dynamically attach additional responsibilities to an object. This pattern provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. Also known as 'Wrapper'.

## Applicability

- use to add dynamically and transparently responsibilities to individual objects without affecting other objects
- when subclassing is impractical, a class definition can be hidden or unavailable for subclassing
